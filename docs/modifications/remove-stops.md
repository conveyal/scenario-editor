It is also possible to remove some of the stops from a route, while leaving the rest of the route untouched. To do this, create a new Remove Stops modification, and select a feed, route, and
patterns as you did when removing trips. You can then use the map to select which stops to remove. Under "Selection," click "new", "add to," or "remove from" to select new stops to remove, add to
the existing selection, or remove from the existing selection. Stops that are selected for removal are listed at the bottom of the modification, as well as being highlighted in red on the map.
