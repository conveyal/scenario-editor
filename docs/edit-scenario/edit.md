# Editing route alignments
Two modification types make use of the map-based route geometry editing tool: :ref:`add_trip_pattern` and :ref:`reroute`. In either case, the goal is to define a new route alignment on the map, including any stops. For the *add trip pattern* type, this is a freestanding route (or part of a route) while for *reroute* it must connect at one or both ends to an existing service in your project's :term:`GTFS bundle`.
