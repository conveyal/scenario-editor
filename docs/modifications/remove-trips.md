Another common modification is to remove trips. The most common use is to remove entire routes, but it is also possible to remove only specific patterns on a particular routes.
In order to remove trips, create a new Remove Trips modification, and select a GTFS feed, route, and optionally the trip pattern of the trips to be removed. All trips on this
route/pattern combination will be removed, and the route will be shown in red on the map. Note that the "active in variants" selector always specifies whether the modification is active,
so in this case implies that the trips will be removed from the selected variants.
