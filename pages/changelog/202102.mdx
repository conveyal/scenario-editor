# Summary

This Conveyal release:

- Adds new options for spatial datasets, such as calculating travel-time matrices for uploaded origin-destination pairs (see below)
- Allows using different destination layers in the same regional accessibility analysis
- Supports higher cutoffs with linear, exponential, and logistic decay functions
- Improves geocoding results for the built-in region and address search
- Corrects a bug that affected adjust-speed modifications with specific segments selected

## Spatial datasets

- Opportunity datasets are now managed through the spatial dataset panel. When uploading a CSV file of points, you can [process it as a freeform pointset](https://docs.conveyal.com/prepare-inputs/upload-spatial-data#freeform-non-grid-points) to keep exact coordinates (in addition to rasterizing to a grid).
- These freeform (non-grid) pointsets can be used as origins and destinations in regional travel time and accessibility calculations. Travel time matrices and other related features require the latest routing engine (v6.2).
- This release improves how polygons with low opportunity densities are disaggregated into raster grids, but polygons with very low densities are still subject to some statistical noise.
- See the user manual or contact your support team for more information.
