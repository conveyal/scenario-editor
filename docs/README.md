This manual will help you use [Conveyal Analysis](http://conveyal.com/analysis) to edit land-use and transportation scenarios, and evaluate them in terms of accessibility.

If you are using the version hosted by Conveyal at [analysis.conveyal.com](http://analysis.conveyal.com), log in with the Chrome browser using the instructions sent via e-mail, then select a region and project to use. Once you have selected a project, you can [edit](edit-scenario) and [analyze](analysis) scenarios.

Most users of analysis.conveyal.com will already have a project prepared when they first log in. If you don't see a region or a project, you'll first need to [prepare a baseline network](prepare-inputs) or get in touch with your support team.
