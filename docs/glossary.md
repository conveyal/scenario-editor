# Glossary

Several terms have a special or specific meaning in the context of Conveyal Analysis. While we hope that their meaning is usually clear enough from the context, this glossary is provided for reference.

   GTFS
      `General Transit Feed Specification <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/>`_, a format for transit network and schedule data. Most transit agencies produce **GTFS** feeds to power customer-facing trip planning applications, but they are also useful for analysis.

   GTFS bundle
      A GTFS bundle is a grouped set of one or more GTFS packages associated with your region. A region can have multiple bundles and a bundle could include a single agency's GTFS or those of several adjacent or overlapping agencies. The bundle is used to represent the baseline transit service and as a starting point for some types of modifications. 

   routing engine
      `Conveyal R5 <https://github.com/conveyal/r5>`_ is the core computational software behind Conveyal Analysis.  It performs one-to-many searches on multimodal (transit/bike/walk/car) transport networks.

   transport network
      A routable network with transit and road layers, built by a specific version of R5. The transit layer is built from a GTFS bundle and the road layer is built from the OpenStreetMap network associated with a region.

   baseline network
      The baseline network is the transport network (i.e. street network plus a GTFS bundle) without any associated modifications. It is a useful point of comparison during analysis and a starting point for most modifications. 

   region
      The region is the rectangular area used for accessibility analysis. It should geographically contain any scheduled transit services and network modifications.

   project
      A project is means of associating scenarios and modifications with a particular GTFS bundle. A project is associated with only one bundle which cannot be changed after it is created. 

   modification
      A modification is an alteration of some kind made to scheduled transit services. e.g. the removal of a line, a rerouting, a new service etc. These must be applied in scenarios to be used in analysis. 

   scenario
      A scenario is a set of modifications packaged together. For example you might create a scenario, called "proposed service cuts" in which several modifications reduce service separately on lines A, B and C. 

   trip pattern
      A trip pattern is a sequence of stops visited by a transit vehicle. A trip pattern can have many trips, and a route consists of a one or more trip patterns. A basic two-way route might consist of two trip patterns - e.g. one for inbound service, one outbound. Each might make stops on different sides of the street and/or in a different order. 

   trip
      A single vehicle trip, representing a vehicle visiting the stops on a particular trip pattern at a particular time.

   hop
      A portion of a trip consisting of a transit vehicle traveling between two consecutive stops.

   isochrone
      An `isochrone <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/isochrone#English>`_ is a boundary around a given origin point defined such that travel from the origin to any point on the boundary takes an equal amount of time. Conveyal Analysis calculates travel time over a departure window, so the travel time used is actually a selected percentile in a distribution of travel times. 

   opportunity dataset
      An opportunity dataset is a spatial dataset with one or more numeric fields representing a count of opportunities (destinations) at particular locations in your :term:`region`. See :ref:`upload_opportunities`.
