# Summary
This Conveyal release:
- Adds new options for spatial datasets, such as calculating travel-time matrices for uploaded origin-destination pairs (see below)
- Allows using different destination layers in the same regional accessibility analysis
- Improves geocoding results for the built-in region and address search
- Corrects a bug that affected adjust-speed modifications with specific segments selected

## Spatial datasets
- Opportunity datasets are now managed through the spatial dataset panel. When uploading a CSV file of points, you can process it as a freeform pointset to keep exact coordinates (in addition to disaggregating to a raster grid).
- Freeform pointsets can be used as origins and destinations in regional travel time and accessibility calculations. Travel time matrices and other related features require the latest routing engine (v6.1.1).
- This release improves how polygons with low opportunity densities are disaggregated into raster grids. Polygons with opportunity counts between 0 and 1 should still be avoided.
- See the user manual or contact your support team for more information.
