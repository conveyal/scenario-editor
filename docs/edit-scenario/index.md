# Overview of network editing

After logging in and selecting a project, you will arrive at the screen below. Each project has an expandable list of numbered **scenarios** followed by a list of **modifications**. Each modification represents a single operation on the baseline [transport network](../glossary.html#transport-network) (for example adding a line, or adjusting the speed of an existing line) and can be [activated](#activating-modifications-in-scenarios) in multiple scenarios.

To prevent data conflicts, the system does not support multiple users or browser tabs editing the same project simultaneously. If you expect multiple people in your organization to be using Conveyal Analysis at the same time, you may want to create projects for each of them, as suggested [below](#usage-suggestions-and-details).

 To add a modification, click
<br><span class="btn btn-success"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Create a modification</span>

This will open a window allowing you to select the [modification type](modifications.html) and enter a name for the modification.  After confirming these details, you will be taken to a modification detail panel that varies by modification type.
