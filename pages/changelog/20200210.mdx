## Regional Analysis Display Update

We refactored the way regional analyses are displayed on the map.

- New blue and red color schemes.
- Locations with 0 opportunities will always be transparent.
- Comparsion breaks switch from one diverging color scheme to a consistent red if negative change, blue if positive change color scheme.
- The comparison break centered around 0 will always be transparent.

To calculate the color breaks for a Regional Analysis we use the [CKMeans](https://simplestatistics.org/docs/#ckmeans) clustering algorithm on a randomly sampled subset of data. This algorithm helps generate cluster.

## Documentation Updates

Made terminology more consistent throughout and expanded the glossary; updated screenshots and instructions for interface elements; and moved materials giving an overview of a feature ahead of any instructions for using it.
