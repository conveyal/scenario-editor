You can generate a report summarizing all of the modifications you have made to a network, for printing
or reference. To access the report, click on the printer icon next to the name of a variant, and all
of the modifications in that variant will be displayed. Keep in mind that some browsers may not print
more than 30 pages or so of a very long report.
