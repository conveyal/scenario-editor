#### Multi-dimensional regional analyses

Previously, each regional analysis ran with a single opportunity dataset, time cutoff, and percentile. This required running multiple analyses, even when the underlying network bundle, scenario, and analysis settings were the same.

This release adds the ability to create a single regional analysis that can be run with multiple opportunity datasets, time cutoffs, and travel time percentiles (for routing engine v5.10.0 and above)

Along with creating multi-dimensional regional analyses, we've overhauled the regional analysis page to allow easy comparisons across these new dimensions.

Additionally, we added options to view all regional analysis settings and an easy way to export the settings and complete scenarios as JSON.

#### Routing engine

The default routing engine version is now v5.10.0. In addition to enabling the features above, this release:

* Considers additional OSM nodes and ways for park-and-ride access. More details are in the [user manual](http://docs.analysis.conveyal.com/en/latest/learn-more/pnr.html)
* Allows transferring from one trip pattern to the same pattern, which may reduce travel times in systems with routes that loop or cross themselves. For example, traveling in London from Notting Hill Gate to Baker Street could involve a transfer at Edgware Road from a Circle Line train to a later train following the same stop pattern. Similarly, traveling in Singapore from Geylang Bahru to Newton could involve a transfer from the Downtown Line at Jalan Besar to an earlier train following the same stop pattern (with a walk to Rochor). Previously, the routing engine included code that would ignore these re-boarding transfers. Removing this code also fixes a bug that would ignore certain other available transfers, in rare cases. Part of the code to ignore re-boarding transfers used an incorrect index, which could randomly coincide with a trip pattern and unintentionally prevent an expected transfer. 

#### Modifications view

We also restyled the modifications list and scenario view. It is now more compact and keeps groups by modification type expanded by default.

We also added an inline text editor for editing the names of modifications, scenarios, and regional analyses. If you can't find the "pencil" icon used previously, try hovering over and clicking the name in order to edit it.
